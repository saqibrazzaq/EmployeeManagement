## Steps
- Add extension method for cors
- Add projects for NLog
  - Contracts - contains interfaces
  - LoggerService - contains logging using NLog
- Add projects for service and repositories
  - Contracts - Base and user repository interfaces
  - Entities - Data model classes for creating database
  - Repository - Base and user repository classes, seed data
  - Service.Contracts - ServiceManager and user service interfaces
  - Service - ServiceManager and user service classes
- Add Get controller
  - Employees.Presentation - Controllers for endpoints
  - GetAllCompanies() method in repository, service and controller
  - Shared project with DataTransferObjects folder
  - CompanyDto
  - AutoMapper - Map Company to CompanyDto
- Global exception handler
  - No try catch blocks needed anywhere
  - All exceptions will be handled and logged using middleware
- All employees and single employee within a company
- csv formatter for companies
- Create company
  - Single company
  - Single company with new employees
  - Multiple companies
  - Get multiple companies
- Delete company
  - Delete single company
  - Delete cascade company with all employees
- Update company
  - Update single company
  - Update with track changes ON
  - No need to call Repository.Update because it updates all columns
  - Get data with track changes ON
  - Move updates from Dto to Entity using AutoMapper
  - Call repository.save(), it will only update which are CHANGED (with track changes)
- Validation
  - Add validation in create and update dto classes
  - Add validation code in ManipulateDto and make it abstract
  - Create and Update Dtos inherit ManipulationDto, so that same validation is at central
- ActionFilters
  - Create new class for checking null Dto and validation
  - Use ServiceFilter attribute in controller for null and model validation
  - No need to check null and if (ModelState.IsValid) in any controller
